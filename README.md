## Project Info

This is a reload from the "updated" template.
This was reloaded from the source because refactoring the code to correct
changes to the host ports was taking too long.
*note: there are known issues with this version of the template and other
issues should be expected because of the host changes that were made.
Scripts will need to be updated to reference the updated port.

## API

Use this as the basis for your own API documentation. Add a new third-level
heading for your custom entities, and follow the pattern provided for the
built-in user authentication documentation.

Scripts are included in [`scripts`](scripts) to test built-in actions. Add your
own scripts to test your custom API. As an alternative, you can write automated
tests in RSpec to test your API.
